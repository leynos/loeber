    <h2>About</h2>
<p>A preliminary player for chat transcripts from the <a href="www.loebner.net/Prizef/loebner-prize.html">Loebner Prize</a> competition, an annual challenge where developers are invited to submit chat robots that must pass a Turing Test.  Currently, only the 2010 format is supported.</p>

<p>The player displays four windows on the screen.  The two "Local" windows are the text typed by a human judge.  One of the remote windows is the input from a human volunteer and the other is that of a computer program.  It is the responsibility of the judge to determine which of these two is the human and which is the computer.</p>

<p>Although the Loebner Prize organization provides chat transcripts in a free form, the player for these is a Windows application.  To make things easier for curious parties, I have written an implementation in JavaScript which will work in most web browsers.</p>

<p>The application makes use of event based JavaScript and DOM manipulation to reproduce the timing of the original keystrokes.</p>

<p>This software makes use of jQuery and underscore.js, copyright their respective developers.</p>

<p>The Loebner Prize Transcripts are in the Public Domain.</p>
