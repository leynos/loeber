A preliminary player for chat transcripts from the Loebner Prize competition, an annual challenge where developers are invited to submit chat robots that must pass a Turing Test.  Currently, only the 2010 format is supported.

The player displays four windows on the screen.  The two "Local" windows are the text typed by a human judge.  One of the remote windows is the input from a human volunteer and the other is that of a computer program.  It is the responsibility of the judge to determine which of these two is the human and which is the computer.

Although the Loebner Prize organization provides chat transcripts in a free form, the player for these is a Windows application.  To make things easier for curious parties, I have written an implementation in JavaScript which will work in most web browsers.

The application makes use of event based JavaScript and DOM manipulation to reproduce the timing of the original keystrokes.

This software makes use of jQuery and underscore.js, copyright their respective developers.

The Loebner Prize Transcripts are in the Public Domain.
